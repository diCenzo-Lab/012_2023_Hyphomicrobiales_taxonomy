# Refining the taxonomy of the order *Hyphomicrobiales* (*Rhizobiales*) based on whole genome comparisons of over 130 genus type strains
 
This repository contains the scripts and input files required to repeat the analyses reported in the associated article. In addition, this repository contains the sets of marker proteins used for phylogenetic analyses and calculation of core-proteome average amino acid identity, which can be used with the [cpAAI_Rhizobiaceae](https://github.com/flass/cpAAI_Rhizobiaceae) pipeline to identify these marker proteins in other organisms.
